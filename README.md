# hmap
A simple and easy to use hashmap implementation in C.

For usage examples look at test.c and interactive_test.c.

To use in your own projects just copy hashmap.h, hashmap.c, jenkins.h and jenkins.c to your environment and compile together with the rest of your source files. Look at the MakeFile for examples.

## Features:
- Supports insert, search, delete operations
- Add metadata to your hashmap elements, useful to add information about stored data types, or just about anything, think about it as a secondary value
- Only a handful of functions to learn, you can pick it up very quickly
